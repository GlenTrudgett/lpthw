""" Comments and Pound Characters """

# example ex2.py

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run")

print("This will run.")
